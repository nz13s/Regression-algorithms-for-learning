#TODO This file is outdated and describes the build for the review from Dec 7th 2020. This needs to be updated.

The following project runs on Python 3.7, requires NumPy and Sklearn libraries, and consists of two subdirectories - main and test.

main contains all the currently implemented algorithms in their bare format.

test contains test classes for each algorithm accordingly, it is strongly advised on running them with the main folder in the same parent directory as each test class imports the required function from main.

The test classes can be run in terminal with Python 3.7 or in an IDE, I specifically used PyCharm 2020.2.3. I prefer doing everything in and IDE as it is easier to control from an UX perspective and it is possible to import the project directly from Git or a folder.

After everything has been imported, running every test class should provide the project marker with a sufficient output, and the code in the main  folder will help the marker analyse my implementations.
